# Machine Learning

This repository provides a collection of simple machine learning projects focused on image classification tasks. The projects are are  implemented with python and Keras/Tensorflow. The hyperparameter tuning is performed using the Keras Tuner. Each project includes a Python script and a Jupyter notebook, which displays the results and outputs of at end of the jupyter notebook.
